        <h1> Directions</h1>

        <h3>STEP 1</h3>
        <p>
            Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, and pepper; cook,
            stirring only once or twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>STEP 2</h3>
        <p>
            Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. Add butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3 minutes. Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir
            in soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>STEP 3</h3>
        <p>Serve immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.</p>

        <p> Tips Cook's Notes: You can use leftover pork, steak, or shrimp in place of chicken. Avoid stirring too much when the rice is added so that it will get lightly crispy and caramelized around the edges... that's the best part!</p>
